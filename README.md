# Code Refactor Homework

A refactored webpage for the Horiseon company

## What's included
Clickable links on the header and accessibility features including images with alt attributes. 
This homepage for Horiseon had a lot of extra code and issues with the links in the header


## Additional Comments
The css has comments and I condensed the code as much as a could without losing functions
